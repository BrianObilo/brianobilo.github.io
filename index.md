# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Security Champions Program. This program was funded by Mozilla Foundation through the [Alumni Connection Grant](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-announces-first-ever-alumni-connection-grant-finalists/). This mentorship and training program was developed to impart knowledge and practical skills on Digital Security for East African Civil Society Organizations. Some of the key things this online resource will cover include:
1. Foundational knowledge of Cybersecurity
2. Cybersecurity threats such as Social Engineering and Malware
3. Personal Security
4. Account Security concepts such as Password Security and, 
5. Securre Online Communications

## Impact

__Mission:__ Nurture new voices and champions of Digital Security for CSOs based in East Africa

__Outcome:__ The Digital Security Chmapions will in turn train and mentor their community members on Digital Security and this will positively impact their security posture. 

## Purpose 

Create a safe space where our Digital Security Champions, mentors and facilitators will learn from another, share ideas and eventually collaborate on Digital Security Projects that will positively impact their security and further their work in the region. 

## Movement Journey ##
1. __Mentee/Participant__ - Our participants are trained and mentored on various Digital Security Concepts. They then become Digital Security Champions for their respective organizations.
2. __Future Mentor/Expert/Facilitator__ - As Security Champions, they can become mentors/leaders, experts and facilitators of future cohorts of our Digital Security Champions Program. They also become trainers & mentors in their respective organizations/communities at the same time.
3. __Cohort Host__ - Some Digital Security Champions may become Cohort Hosts and assist in running the Digital Security Champions Program. Others become Hosts in their counterparts' Digital Security Initiatives.   
4. __Eventually lead their own Digital Security Initiatives__ - After training and mentoring, we expect that most, if not all our mentees, will be in a position to lead their own Digital Security Initiatives. 

## Multipliers ##

__Centralized Learning__ - I run a large webinar that trains a 1,000 people a year.

__Mentoring Multipliers__ - I mentor 3 mentees on Digital Security for every 4 months and every mentee goes on to do the same.

Year   | Centralized Learning  | Mentoring Multipliers
-------| --------------------  |-----------------------
1      |    1000               | 9
2      |    2000               | 81
3      |    3000               | 729
4      |    4000               | 6561
5      |    5000               | 59049

It's crucial to have people in the movement who are onboarding others in a way that multiplies itself.
