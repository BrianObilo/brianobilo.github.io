# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Accessible Online Security Program -  a training and mentorship program aimed at imparting knowledge and practical skills on Online Security and Digital Privacy. With the increased migration of operations online i.e business, education and e-commerce, there is a dire need to ensure everyone keep their information(especially their didgital data) safe. This program aims at raising awareness on Online Security and nurturing the next generation of Digital Safety champions. Over a period of 14 weeks, starting from April 8th 2020, this program will focus on the follwing key main areas as our pillars:

1. Information Security
2. Secure Online Communication
3. Privacy Laws and Regulation

We were interviewed by the Mozilla Foundation on what our program entails and and you can read [it here](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/accessible-online-security-open-leaders-x-program/). 

## Impact

__Vision:__ Nurture new voices of Openness and Digital Safety in our community.

__Outcome:__ The Open Leaders will in turn train and mentor their community members on Online Security and Digital Safety and this will positively impact and promote Internet Health.

## Purpose 

Create a safe space where our mentees and mentors will learn from another, share ideas and eventually collaborate on Open Source Projects that promote Internet Health.

## Urgency ##
Kenyans were ranked the most care-free users of the Internet globally. Only four in every 10 internet users in Kenya are concerned about their privacy online, according to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) released on September 2019. This is the lowest level in the world according to the report and ranks poorly against the global average of eight in every 10 users. Read the [official report by UNCTAD here](https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/der2019_en.pdf) and the [press release here.](https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kenyans-the-most-carefree-users-of-internet/1056-5261054-1b6rqjz/index.html) 

Furthermore, Kenya spends up to __295M USD__ in responding to cybercrime cases yearly. Among the top ranking types of cybercrime include social engineering and identity theft, email spam and phishing, and online fraud scams. Despite having one of the highest internet usage rates in the continent, there is a distinct skill gap on digital safety. These are the main reasons why we decided to start the Accessible Online Security Training Program. 

## Movement Journey ##
1. __Mentee/Participant__ - Open Leaders are trained and mentored on various Online Security and Digital Safety Concepts. 
2. __Future Mentor/Expert/Facilitator__ - Open Leaders become mentors, experts and facilitators of future cohorts of our Accessible Online Security Program. They also become trainers & mentors in their local community.
3. __Cohort Host__ - Some Open Leaders may become Cohort Hosts and assist in running the Accessible Online Security Program. Others become Hosts in their counterparts' Open Leaders Programs.   
4. __Eventually lead their own Open Leaders Programs__ - After training and mentoring, we expect that most, if not all our mentees, will be in a position to lead their own Open Leaders Programs that promote Internet Health.

## Multipliers ##

One of the most important concepts we learned in the Open Leaders X Program is the advantage Mentoring Multipliers has over Centralized Learning. 

__Centralized Learning__ - I run a large webinar that trains a 1,000 people a year

__Mentoring Multipliers__ - I mentor 2 mentees every 6 months and every mentee goes on to do the same.

Year   | Centralized Learning  | Mentoring Multipliers
-------| --------------------  |-----------------------
1      |    1000               | 9
2      |    2000               | 81
3      |    3000               | 729
4      |    4000               | 6561
5      |    5000               | 59049

It's crucial to have people in the movement who are onboarding others in a way that multiplies itself.
