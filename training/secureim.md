# 6.1 Secure your Instant Messaging Apps

## Whatsapp

These settings are a reasonable middle ground for reducing the amount of data that the app creates locally, and minimizing what is exposed as clear text on iCloud/Google Drive.

1. __Go to: Settings -> Account -> Privacy__

* Tweak the following settings:

  * Last Seen: My Contacts

  * Profile Photo: My Contacts

  * Status: My Contacts

  * Read Receipts: OFF

2.__Go to: Settings -> Account -> Security__

* Tweak the following settings:

  * Show Security Notifications: ON

3. __Go to: Settings -> Chats__

* Tweak the following settings:

  * Save Incoming Media: OFF

  * Chat Backup -> Auto Backup: OFF

4. __Go to: Settings -> Notifications__

* Tweak the following settings:

  * Show Preview: OFF (unfortunately, this still displays the sender’s name)
  
## Telegram
1. Enable 2-factor authentication:

* Instructions: [How 2-step verification works](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-does-2-step-verification-work){:target="_blank"}
* Enable: Settings –> Privacy and Security –> 2-Step Verification

2. Use username and share it instead of the phone number.

* Username can be changed. Phone numbers can’t.
* However any usernames are searchable and anyone can send you a messages via t.me/username.

3. Telegram provides groups and user-to-user chat. Both types can be secured.

* User-to-user chat is not end-to-end encrypted by default. To encrypt it, you need to enable a feature called Secret Chats:

  * More information: [Secret Chats](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats){:target="_blank"}
  * The Secret Chats feature encrypts communication between two users.
  * The admins of Telegram can’t read it.
  * If you delete a message, the copy on the other side will be deleted too.
  * You can set a timer after which a message will be deleted.
  * These two features are useful in case the device is seized or stolen.
  * You can enable notifications to learn if the other side takes screenshots. But this is not available on all platforms (especially Android).
  * Secret Chat can be started as follows:
    * iOS: Start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Messages). Then tap “New secret chat”.
    * Android: Swipe right to open the menu, then ‘New secret chat’.

4. If you are managing a Group on Telegram:

* Groups are private by default. They can be turned to public.
* Group Permissions: It is useful to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content if inappropriate.
* The administrator can delete inappropriate content.

## Signal

* You can find a good introduction to Signal in this article by Martin Shelton: [Signal beginners](https://freedom.press/news/signal-beginners/){:target="_blank"}.
* Secure Signal following these instructions, also by Martin Shelton: [Locking down Signal](https://medium.com/@mshelton/locking-down-signal-d71678f653d3){:target="_blank"}.
* Signal can only be registered through an existing phone number, which becomes the user’s identifier. If you prefer not to use your personal phone number or to share it with your contacts, you can register Signal with a burner SIM card (if available in your country), or with an online phone service. You can find instructions on how to do this in this tutorial: [Signal tutorial: second phone number](https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/signal-tutorial-second-phone-number/){:target="_blank"}.

## Wire
Wire can be registered with a phone number or an email address. Instructions for registering a Wire account with an email address can be found here: [How can I register with an email?](https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000165369-How-can-I-register-with-an-email-){:target="_blank"}.

Features:

* 1:1 IM, group chat, voice messages, file sharing, voice calls, and 1:1 video calls are all end-to-end encrypted.
* You can verify the identity of other users’ devices.
* You can set a timer for disappearing messages, or delete messages in your recipient’s devices.

## Facebook Messenger
Facebook Messenger can also be used for end-to-end encrypted communications, but this feature is not the default. Secret messages can be used for sending messages, pictures, stickers, videos, and voice messages. This feature cannot be used for group messages and voice or video calls.

To start a so called Secret Conversation:

1. Tap the button to write a message in the top right of the app.
1. Tap “Secret” in the top right.
1. Select who you want to message.
1. If you want, tap the timer icon in the text box and set a timer to make the messages disappear.
Secret conversations are currently only available in the Messenger app on iOS and Android, so they won’t appear on Facebook chat or messenger.com.
