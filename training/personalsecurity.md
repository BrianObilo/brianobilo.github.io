# Personal Security

Kenyans were ranked the most care-free users of the Internet globally. Only four in every 10 internet users in Kenya are concerned about their privacy online, according to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released on September 2019. Read the [official report by UNCTAD here](https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/der2019_en.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the [press release from NMG here.](https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kenyans-the-most-carefree-users-of-internet/1056-5261054-1b6rqjz/index.html){:target="_blank"}

This is the lowest level in the world according to the report and ranks poorly against the global average of eight in every 10 users. This clearly indicates that there’s a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure Kenyans protect their data and Personally Identifiable Information to the best of their abilities.
