# 6. Secure Online Communications

Secure Online Communications is one of the most important aspects of Online Security. Here’s what a secure form of communication looks like:
* __Private-__ Your information shouldn’t be viewable by any third parties.
* __Hard to penetrate-__ It should be extremely difficult for any cybercriminals to break into your system by guessing your password, exploiting bad code, or leveraging API loopholes.
* __Reliable-__ Your communication should be consistently reliable, with no interruptions or vulnerabilities to exploit.

To support you in staying safe online, we will share tools and products that you can leverage to enhance your digital security. 

__NOTE:__ As you explore the tools, please keep these points in your mind.

* Despite the sophistication of the tools mentioned below, you should not rely solely on digital products for your online safety. Your security starts with __YOU.__
* It is impossible to be 100% secure online. 
* You should always make sure you are following all the laws and regulations like [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/){:target="_blank"} and [Kenya's Computer Misuse and cybercrimes Act, 2018](http://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/ComputerMisuseandCybercrimesActNo5of2018.pdf){:target="_blank"} (even if they are burdensome)
* Carefully review and understand the privacy policies of the tools before using them.
* Adopting new technology is like a behavior change – it takes time and effort, so be patient if you decide to adopt and use one of the tools.
