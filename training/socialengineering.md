# Social Engineering
Social engineering is a technique that uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information. This is one of the greatest threats to cybersecurity today because it takes advantage of people’s trusting nature hence it is less predictable and harder to detect and respond to. 

Ideally, an attacker gathers information about a user and uses it to establish trust. Once trust is established, the attacker gets the targeted information without raising suspicion. 

> Social Engineering undoubtedly presents the greatest threat to confidentiality today. 

## Types of Social Engineering Techniques
### 1. Phishing 
Phishing is one of the most popular social engineering techniques. It involves scams sent via emails, text messages or calls. These scams create a sense of urgency or inspire fear in the target causing them to click on malicious links, divulge sensitive information or download malicious attachments.<br/> 

Phishing done via text messages is known as __smishing__ while phishing done via phone calls is known as __vishing__. Vishing can be combined with other forms of social engineering
Attackers also take advantage of current events and certain times of the year. These include: 
* Natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, Indonesian tsunami)
* Epidemics and health scares (e.g. Covid-19, H1N1)
*	Economic concerns (e.g., IRS scams)
*	Major political elections
*	Holidays

Examples of Phishing Scams
* An employee can receive an email that looks to be from Facebook, alerting them to change their passwords. The email also contains a link to almost a replica of Facebook’s login page. Upon clicking and inputting their username and password, these credentials are sent to the attacker. 
* An instance of smishing is when people send crafted MPESA messages. The attacker then proceeds to call and create a sense of urgency, deceiving the target to send money to the attacker. 

### 2. Spear Phishing
Spear phishing is a __targeted form__ of phishing. It targets specific individuals, or organization. These scams are usually tailored to fit the target’s characteristics such as job position and contacts. This makes it less conspicuous. Therefore, spear phishing has a higher success rate but takes longer to plan and execute. 

### 3. Baiting
