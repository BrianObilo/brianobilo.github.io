# 5. Password Security 

Passwords are used to log into most systems and applications. With increasing number of online accounts, people have a tendency to use simple and easy to remember passwords that are shared among these sites. For instance, you will find someone using the same password for both gmail and facebook. 
Cyber attackers will try common password phrases in an attempt to crack your password. If correctly cracked, the attacker has access to all the sites that this password is used.

## How are passwords discovered?

1. __Interception__ - Passwords can be intercepted as they travel over a network.
1. __Brute force__ - Automated guessiong of billions of passwords until correct one is found. 
1. __Dictionary attacks__ - Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations— such as __qwerty__ or __asdfg__. Don’t use dictionary words, slang terms, common misspellings, or words spelled backward. These cracks rely on software that automatically plugs common words into password fields. 
1. __Key logging__ - Installing a keylogger to intercept passwords when they are entered.  
1. __Shoulder surfing__ - Observing someone typing in their password. 
1. __Manual guessing__ - Information posted online such as dates of birth or pet names can be used to guess passwords.
1. __Cracking security questions__ - When you click the __“forgot password”__ link within a webmail service or other site, you’re asked to answer a question or series of questions. The answers can often be found on your social media profile.
1. __Phishing and coercion__ - Using social engineering techniques to trick people into revealing passwords.  
1. __Data breaches__ - Using the passwords leaked from data breaches to attack other systems. 
1. __Stealing passwords__ - Insecurely stored passwords can be stolen, such as ones written on sticky notes and kept near(or on) devices
1. __Stolen hashes__ - Stolen hash files can be broken to recover the original passwords. 
1. __Password spraying__ - Trying a commonly-used passwords to access a large number of accounts. 

Passwords can only do so much. Even when implemented correctly, passwords are limited in helping prevent unauthorized access.
If an attacker discovers or guesses the password, they are unable to impersonate a user.
