# Accessible Online Security | A Mozilla Open Leaders X Program 
## Introduction ##
The Accessible Online Security program is a training and mentorship program aimed at imparting knowledge and practical experience on Online Security and Digital Privacy to members of our community. With the increased migration of operations online (eg. business, education, ), there is a need to ensure people keep their digital data safe. This program aims at raising awareness and next generation of digital safety activists. Over a period of 14 weeks, starting from February 2020, this program will focus on three key main areas as our pillars:
1. Information Security
2. Secure Online Communication
3. Privacy Laws and Regulation 

## Impact ##
Vision: Nurture new voices of Openness and Digital Safety in our community. 

Outcome: The Open Leaders will in turn train and mentor their community members on Online Security and Digital Safety and this will positively impact and promote Internet Health. 

## Purpose ##
Create a safe space where our mentees and mentors will learn from another, share ideas and eventually collaborate on Open Source Projects that promote Internet Health.

## Urgency ##
Kenyans were ranked the most care-free users of the Internet globally. Only four in every 10 internet users in Kenya are concerned about their privacy online, according to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) released on September 2019. This is the lowest level in the world according to the report and ranks poorly against the global average of eight in every 10 users. 

Furthermore, Kenya spends up to 295M USD in responding to cybercrime cases yearly. Among the top ranking types of cybercrime include social engineering and identity theft, email spam and phishing, and online fraud scams. Despite having one of the highest internet usage rates in the continent, there is a distinct skill gap on digital safety.
